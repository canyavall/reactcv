# Pacman

The target of today's project is to build a game the closest you can to [Pacman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man).

The first iteration should have at least the Pacman moving in the canvas with the keyboard.

Once you have a moving Pacman you can start implementing some walls.

Finally add the ghosts.

### Webpack and ES6

Use Webpack and ES6 classes to build your Pacman.

For the first iteration you should have `Game`, `Board` and `Pacman` classes.

Do not write all your code in one single file. Take advantage of Webpack and separate the classes each in a different file.

If you want to use a class in another file, just import it: `import Pacman from './Pacman';`.

**Have fun!**

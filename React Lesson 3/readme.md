# JS-React - Day 2

The first 2 days where the basics of the libraries.

However, there are still a few more things to learn.

You will not be comfortable yet with Redux. Don't worry, Redux is not going away.

We need to add one last tool to our React toolset: React Router. With it you will be able to navigate to different pages.

Today's notes:

- [React Router](react_router.md)
- [Intro Redux middleware](intro_redux_middleware.md)
- [Presentational vs Containers](presentational_vs_containers.md)

Project:

- [Trivial](trivial.md)
